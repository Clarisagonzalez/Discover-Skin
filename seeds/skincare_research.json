Azelaic acid is an organic acid that has anti-inflammatory properties that help to tackle both acne and hyperpigmentation. Vitamin C is a rich source of antioxidants which adeptly slows down melanin production by inhibiting the action of the enzyme tyrosinase, which is responsible for melanin production. In addition, vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant which helps to depigment the hyperpigmentation spots on the skin and works in collagen synthesis providing optimal photoprotection. Kojic acid is derived from a certain type of fungus and is useful in preventing all types of hyperpigmentation, including post-inflammatory, sun-induced, and age spots. Niacinamide, or vitamin B3, is a skin-lightening compound which limits pigmentation issues by inhibiting the transfer of melanosome. This means that it limits the transfer of small structures in a cell that cause pigmentation. Look out for these and the other previously mentioned ingredients when shopping for hyperpigmentation treatment anywhere on the face, including your lips!  Remember, because retinol increases UV sensitivity, be sure to only treat your skin with it during night time. ",
